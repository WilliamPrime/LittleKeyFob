This was just a quick 3d printable key fob threw together.

The design is based off a core XY belt, like the ones you would find a modern 3d printer.

I designed it with multicolour printing in mind\

the large size is 72x72x6mm
the small size is 36x36x6mm

probably should have put this on printables instead of here oops
